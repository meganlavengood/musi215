## Class topic

[Pentatonic harmony](https://viva.pressbooks.pub/openmusictheory/chapter/pentatonic-harmony/)

## Homework assigned

[Songwriting composition project](https://gmuedu-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/mlavengo_gmu_edu/Ecu9DjxumaJHlsIwz8b-Pl4BVglynGzMpofEH-p44X7Zdg?e=yj2nXD). I suggest picking a set of lyrics at least before Tuesday. If you have time for more work, choose chord progressions and plot out the form of your song too. Bring your laptops (or whatever you write music on) and headphones for a "lab" session on Tuesday.
